## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Linguistics Program at the University of South Carolina. My research lies at the intersection of second language acquisition and neuroscience, with a special focus on the processing of semantics and emotional prosody. I am co-advised by Drs. Jiang Liu and Rutvik Desai. 

My dissertation investigates how native and non-native speakers perceive emotional prosody in a tonal language—Mandarin Chinese, and examines how semantics influence the emotional prosody processing of L1 and L2 Chinese speakers, and uses fMRI to elucidate whether native speakers and L2 learners use similar brain mechanisms to process semantics and emotional prosody in Mandarin Chinese words and sentences. 


## News

- **[July, 2023]** Our abstract comparing the semantic effects on emotional prosody perception in L1 and L2 speakers has been accepted for BUCLD 48, and I received the Paula Menyuk Travel Award.
- **[May, 2023]** I won the Graduate Student Poster Award at Discover USC 2023.
- **[Febuary, 2023]** Our abstract about semantic effect on emotional prosody perception has been accepted for HSP 36, and I received the HSP Student Travel Award.
