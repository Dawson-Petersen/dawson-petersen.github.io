## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Linguistics Program](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/linguistics/index.php) at the [University of South Carolina](https://sc.edu) under [Dr. Amit Almor](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/psychology/our_people/directory/almor_amit.php). My research focuses the relationshio between linguistic framing and reasoning. Specifically, I am investigating in the ways that the semantic-syntactic features of animacy, agency, and subjecthood change reader perceptions of AI responsibility. My Dissertation is entitled "The Effects of Anthropomorphic Linguistic Framing on the Online Sentence Processing of Texts about AI".

## Dissertation Abstract  

Linguistic framing effects show that subtle differences in how information is presented can dramatically change how readers evaluate and respond to the situation depicted in a text, even when the propositional content is unchanged (Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2011; McGlynn & McGlone, 2019). This is especially true with regards to the assignment of agency (Fausey & Boroditsky, 2010; Dragojevic et al., 2010). Grammatical and lexical resources such as passivization (Recanati, 2002) and lexical (Lakoff & Ferguson, 2006; Thibodeau & Boroditsky, 2011) and grammatical metaphors (e.g., placing a non-agent in subject position of an active clause, Devrim, 2015; McGlynn & McGlone, 2019) even allow grammatical agency to be assigned to non-agents resulting in linguistic anthropomorphism (i.e., the ascription of human characteristics to non-humans). A variety of studies using offline judgment measures have shown that linguistic framing affects how participants reason about agency and responsibility. However, insufficient research has investigated 1) the effects of linguistic framing on online text processing and 2) how this linguistic phenomenon interacts with the psychological phenomenon of anthropomorphism (Heider & Simmel, 1944; Epley et al., 2007). Regarding the first question—because extant research on linguistic framing typically relies on judgement measures which are collected after participants read a text, it is not clear whether the effect occurs online during linguistic processing or only afterwards during deliberate reasoning. Regarding the second question—different theories of anthropomorphism (Epley et al., 2007; Dennett, 1987) make different predictions about the extent to which anthropomorphic linguistic framing will cause readers to make automatic elaborative inferences about the target’s goals, beliefs, etc. Specifically, we will investigate both of these issues in the context of AI and AI large language models (LLMs) as these models are hypothesized to be especially likely to be anthropomorphized (Mitchell & Krakauer, 2023). Therefore, the proposed dissertation project will fill these gaps in the literature by using an eye-tracking reading paradigm to investigate how anthropomorphic linguistic framing affects the online processing of texts about LLMs compared to other AIs, and computer programs.
